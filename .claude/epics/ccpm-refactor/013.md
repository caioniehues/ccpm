# Task: Enhance parallel-worker with Dependency Awareness

> **⚠️ REQUIRED: Use `/taches:create-subagent` skill when modifying this subagent.**
> This skill provides expert guidance on subagent structure, tool selection, and best practices.
> Invoke this skill to ensure enhancements follow proper patterns.

## Description
Enhance the existing parallel-worker subagent to understand task dependencies and coordinate with the parallel-orchestrator.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] parallel-worker can read task dependencies from frontmatter
- [ ] parallel-worker waits for dependencies before starting
- [ ] parallel-worker signals completion to orchestrator
- [ ] parallel-worker handles conflicts_with constraints
- [ ] Integration with parallel-orchestrator
- [ ] Maintains existing parallel execution capabilities

## Existing Agent Location
- `ccpm/agents/parallel-worker.md` (enhance, don't replace)

## Enhancements
1. Parse depends_on from task frontmatter
2. Wait for dependency completion signals
3. Signal own completion when done
4. Handle conflicts_with to prevent concurrent execution
5. Coordinate with parallel-orchestrator for status

## Definition of Done
Parallel worker respects dependency ordering and coordinates with orchestrator.
