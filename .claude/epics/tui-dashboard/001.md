# Task: Create /pm:epic-wizard Command

## Description

Create a new slash command `/pm:epic-wizard` that orchestrates the complete epic creation workflow with approval gates between each phase. This command guides users through PRD creation, epic generation, task decomposition, and optional GitHub sync with explicit approval at each step.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/pm:epic-wizard {name}` creates a guided workflow
- [ ] Phase 1: PRD creation using existing `/pm:prd-new` behavior
- [ ] Phase 2: Epic generation using existing `/pm:prd-parse` behavior
- [ ] Phase 3: Task decomposition using existing `/pm:epic-decompose` behavior
- [ ] Phase 4: Optional GitHub sync (yes/no/skip options)
- [ ] Pauses after each phase for user approval
- [ ] Recognizes approval phrases: "yes", "approved", "looks good", "proceed", "continue", "ok", "lgtm"
- [ ] Recognizes revision phrases: "no", "changes", "revise", "edit", "modify"
- [ ] Collects revision feedback when user requests changes

## File to Create

## Workflow Logic

```
Phase 1: PRD Creation
├── Execute /pm:prd-new {name}
├── Output: .claude/prds/{name}.md
├── PAUSE: "Review the PRD above. Do you approve it?"
├── If approved → Add status: approved to frontmatter, proceed
└── If revision → Collect feedback, revise, ask again

Phase 2: Epic Generation
├── Execute /pm:prd-parse {name}
├── Output: .claude/epics/{name}/epic.md
├── PAUSE: "Review the epic structure. Do you approve it?"
├── If approved → Add status: approved to frontmatter, proceed
└── If revision → Collect feedback, regenerate, ask again

Phase 3: Task Decomposition
├── Execute /pm:epic-decompose {name}
├── Output: .claude/epics/{name}/001.md, 002.md, ...
├── PAUSE: "Review the {N} tasks. Ready to begin work?"
├── If approved → Mark epic as approved-for-work, proceed
└── If revision → Adjust tasks, ask again

Phase 4: GitHub Sync (Optional)
├── Ask: "Sync to GitHub? (yes/no/skip)"
├── If yes → Execute /pm:epic-sync {name}
├── If no → Continue with local-only tracking
└── If skip → User can run /pm:epic-sync later

Success: "Epic '{name}' ready! Run /pm:next to start first task."
```

## Definition of Done

- Command file created with proper YAML frontmatter
- XML structure with `<objective>`, `<process>`, `<success_criteria>` tags
- All four phases implemented with approval gates
- Approval phrase detection working
- Revision feedback loop working
